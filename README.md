# Non-Commercial Experience

Actually I deleted most of my previous projects and barely can remember them. I was starting from developing of Discord bots in Python, then in JavaScript and then in TypeScript.<br>
I don't have any cool public projects in TypeScript and you can only look how I was solving test tasks for interviews in my repositories.

## Space Station 14
This is a game born from Space Station 13 which is being developed in C# in its own engine called RobustToolbox.<br>
Actually I was working on forks based on this game. Firstly I came to Space Stories project where I started my path as game-dev and path of C# developer, I worked here for couple of months in free pace combining it with high school and leaved due to conflict with Space Stories director. I leaved with a couple of people and then we decided to start our own project based on Space Station 14.

## Space Exodus
Long story short, I'm chief developer which initiated the entire development and is actively continuing to work on the project. I am working both on creating new content, as well as conducting a code review. I'm the co-owner of the project.<br>

I've got a lot of experience with C#, RobustToolbox, ASP.NET. Got a lot of experience in math, OpenGL and GPU work. Got a lot of experience of working in a projects with truly big codebases. Got a lot of experience of working with other people and being their leader.
