Time-Zone: Europe/Moscow, UTC+3 (GMT+0300, MSK);

# Commercial Experience
As TypeScript developer: around 1 year

## My first job
My first job was FullStack TypeScript developer, it was NikiFilini company which was specialized on tailoring where I worked for 3 months and leaved due to studies (I was in high school).<br>
My stack was: Nest.JS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, AWS S3, ElasticSearch, React.JS, Mobx.

In the development team was only 2 people: Me and team-leader. I was at level of junior and had a lot of communications with team-leader how to do stuff.

### Internal project of company - CRM wrapper
Being short, project was a CRM which was built upon 3rd party services like RetailCRM amd My.Sklad (Мой.Склад) giving to the workers functions and logic they were missing in that services with automatizing of their work.<br>
I was working on it for one month and after it company decided I'm more needed in other project - manga library application.<br>
I had a lot of different tasks mainly focused on bussiness logic and I can't mention something specific here, the project already was big and had defined codebase without problems that I had to resolve.<br>

### TrendyManga - Manga library and reading web-app
I had to start from scratch, entire application and I decided it's stack at the start. I was writing first catalog, first authorization, first reading, parsers of other manga web-sites and etc.<br>
I was given Figma layout which was developer by some other designer I didn't had contact which. And had experience of working with SEO specialist.<br>
I was working for it 2 moths and leaved after it due to studies.<br>

## UniPlay - Game accounts marketplace
I am heavily restricted in how much information I can disclose about the project due to a perpetual non-disclosure agreement. I can only mention that I worked solely as a backend developer and also performed sysadmin duties. The team consisted only of me and a frontend developer who handled the design work.

The core idea of the project was a marketplace for Steam and Epic Games accounts, where the accounts were fully transferred to the platform’s automated management. The platform verified that the accounts were valid and prevented users from revoking access to them. I worked on this project for nine months, and it was nearly ready for release. However, in the final months, due to a conflict with the project lead, both I and the other developer left, after which the project was shut down.

# Non-Commercial Experience

Actually I deleted most of my previous projects and barely can remember them. I was starting from developing of Discord bots in Python, then in JavaScript and then in TypeScript.<br>
I don't have any cool public projects in TypeScript and you can only look how I was solving test tasks for interviews in my repositories.

## Space Station 14
This is a game born from Space Station 13 which is being developed in C# in its own engine called RobustToolbox.<br>
Actually I was working on forks based on this game. Firstly I came to Space Stories project where I started my path as game-dev and path of C# developer, I worked here for couple of months in free pace combining it with high school and leaved due to conflict with Space Stories director. I leaved with a couple of people and then we decided to start our own project based on Space Station 14.

## Space Exodus
Long story short, I'm chief developer which initiated the entire development and is actively continuing to work on the project. I am working both on creating new content, as well as conducting a code review. I'm the co-owner of the project: all the intellectual property of the project belongs to me.<br>

I've got a lot of experience with C#, RobustToolbox, ASP.NET. Got a lot of experience in math, OpenGL and GPU work. Got a lot of experience of working in a projects with truly big codebases. Got a lot of experience of working with other people and being their leader.

We're working almost a year already, we've got a cool command of enthusiasts and not going to be limited only by Space Station 14.
